                "Name": "Malaysia UK Research and Innovation Bridges Competition",
                "Actions": ["Health and Care", "Energy", "Urban Living", "Agriculture", "Food"],
                "Overview": "Innovate UK has partnered with the Malaysia Industry-Government Group for High Technology to provide a total of £14.4 million of funding to collaborative research and development projects proposing solutions to the multiple challenges faced by Malaysia as climate change impacts upon its cities. To meet this challenge, applicants must demonstrate the clear translation of existing research into products, services or processes making an impact in the following areas: Health and well-being, Improving environmental resilience and energy security, Future cities, Agritech, and Digital innovation and creativity (See Technological Themes for detail). Contracts will be given to applicants focusing on industrial research: investigations aimed at the improvement of existing products, the construction of prototypes, and more (See Key Terms). Each collaborative industrial research project will be eligible for £1-3 million (£1-1.75 million costs on each side).  Applicants will go through a 2-stage application and assessment process. Phase 1 involves the submission of an expression of interest. Successful applicants will then be invited to complete a full application as part of phase 2 (30th Nov).",
                "Technological Themes": [{"Health and Wellbeing": "Solutions addressing health and well-being in an urban setting. There is a specific request for solutions to rapidly identify diseases and their vectors, and measures to reduce or eliminate communicable diseases in the urban environment."},
                                           {"Environmental Resilience and Energy Security": "Solutions promoting urban growth and environmental resilience. There is a specific request for technologies related to vertical farming, efficient waste management, and the delivery of energy generation and delivery systems. Energy systems resilient to climate change induced disasters are of great interest here."},
                                           {"Future Cities": "Co-design solutions to tackle inadequate housing, traffic congestion& pollution. There is a specific request for waste to energy/waste conversion technologies; virtual communications ; and efficient mass transportation/logistics management systems."},
                                           {"Agriculture": "Solutions to meet increasing food demand in the face of climate change. There is a specific request for disease/pest resistant crops, fast growing crops, crops able to survive in harsh climatic conditions, and methods to preserve and transport food."},
                                           {"Digital Innovation & Creativity": "Solutions to leverage advanced information systems to create educational, cultural, and creative assets within the urban environment. "}]}
